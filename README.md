Pet Planner
A comprehensive digital assistant for pet owners to manage feeding schedules, vet appointments, medication timing, and daily care routines.
Problem
For millions of pet owners, keeping track of multiple pets with different care needs can be overwhelming. While some pets are natural reminders (like vocal cats at mealtime), others are more passive and rely entirely on their owners to maintain consistent care schedules. Currently, most pet owners juggle phone reminders, paper calendars, and mental checklists, leading to:

Missed feedings
Forgotten medications
Inconsistent routines
Impacted pet health and happiness

Create customized schedules for each pet
