# Jake Billiams
As Jake Billiams, a busy pet owner with 2 cats,
I want to set up automated feeding schedules with reminders,
so that I can ensure consistent feeding times and free up time for more play with my cats.


# Julia Boberts
As Julia Boberts, a pet owner who values consistency,
I want a reliable reminder system with medicine tracking,
so that I never miss a dose and can monitor my dog's treatment progress.


# Perry Botter
As Perry Botter, a pet owner going on vacation with 2 birds, 2 ferrets, and 1 dog,
I want to share a detailed care schedule with notes to my friend,
so that my pet sitter has accurate information about each animal's needs while I'm away.

# Jessica Jaxon
As Jessica Jaxon, a pet owner with dogs at different life stages,
I want to easily delete individual pet profiles and their associated data,
so that I can gracefully transition after losing my senior dog without receiving reminders for their care tasks.
